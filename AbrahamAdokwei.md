Working of this website came with its own challenges mostly because it was my first time working with **Blogdown**. Reading through the documention at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html was helpful to get me started. I also found post by [Shilaan Alzahawi](https://shilaan.rbind.io/post/building-your-website-using-r-blogdown/) and [Daniel Quintana](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) very helpful. 

Looking forward, I'll work on updating this website to reflect my current self.
